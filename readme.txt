Comments:

	Sketchy company, misleading and manipulative. 
	They target the unemployed but dnn't have any actual positions to offer and
	give poor accessment reviews to attract potential customers for their paid training sessions.
	Public for future references as I ended up doing their "accessment". 
	Truthfully, don't waste your time on them.
